# gaussian-reader

The gaussian-reader is a user-friendly Python program designed to streamline the analysis of input and output files generated during the optimization procedure of molecules using Gaussian, a popular computational chemistry software. With its intuitive interface, the program offers a range of essential analytical capabilities, including the examination of input parameters, thermochemistry, and frequencies of molecules.

## Features

- Analyze basic information such as input parameters, thermochemistry, and frequencies of molecules.
- Visualize the initial and optimized molecular structures.
- Plot the energy changes during the optimization steps.
- Convert z-matrix formatted initial coordinates to Cartesian coordinates for further analysis.

Please note that the gaussian-reader is still in its early stages of development and may not yet incorporate all desired features. However, it serves as a valuable tool for quickly analyzing Gaussian input and output files.

## Usage

- Run the main_window.py file.
- When prompted, provide the relevant input and output files. Example files are located in the "files" directory.

## Requirements

- Python (version 3.10.11)
- Dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
